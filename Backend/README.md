## Donations Web API.
Overview.
a. Management of Administrator: Like many popular blogs today, administrator management is the most basic. As a developer, I added the admin backend add, login feature. It is worth mentioning that I set a super password to ensure the security of the app and prevent the interface from being called. Users will be authenticated when they log in. No such user and password errors will prevent login. As a developer, I can manage users on the cloud database. b. Management of Category: Users can add categories to their blogs before writing a single article. Users can add categories, and if they do not meet the character limit, they will be prompted with an error. Users can view the created categories and can specify to update their names. Finally, the user can delete the specified category. c. Management of Article: For the main part of the blog, the user can post the article, the tag of the article (title, body, author, date and permissions, where the permission means that the user can set the blog to be invisible to others). Users can view all articles that have been sent, or they can be categorized to find a specific article. Users can also modify the specified content including title, body and author. Of course, users can also delete the specified article.
